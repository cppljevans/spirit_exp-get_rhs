# spirit_exp-get_rhs
copy of spirit-experiments/workbench/x3/workbench-get_rhs

This copy enables different branches of the spirit-experiments repository 
to be tested with what's in this repository.  Without this copy, then
each of the different branches would duplicate what's here, which is
a waste and, IIUC, would make keeping test code the same across the
various branches, harder.
